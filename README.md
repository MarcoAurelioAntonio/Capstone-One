## Descrption

In this capstone project you are going to build is based on an online website for a conference:

    -We provide some design guidelines for you to create the website, but you must personalize the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the you personalize your project so that you have something unique in your portfolio to share with potential employers during job searching.
    
## Live Demo

### General requirements

- Project requirements
You should personalize the content of your page. Choose a topic that is different than the one in the original design.

You should follow the design guidelines, including:

- Colors.
Typography: font face, size and weight (we suggest using Lato as it is a free font similar to the one used in the original design).
Layout: composition and space between elements.
The pages should look almost identical to the original design. Small adjustments like text or image changes are acceptable.

- You should build only these 2 pages:
    - The home page.
    - The about page.

- Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
    - Mobile: up to 768px wide.
    - Desktop: 768px or wider.
    - Interactions

- Links
    - The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
    - The logo in the header links to the home page.
    - Mobile menu
    - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
    - There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
    - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.

- Dynamic page

The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
